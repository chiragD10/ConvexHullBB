The above algorithm has been implemented in C++. Throughout the course of the algorithm, we store the faces (along with their interior points involving triangulation), edges (along with their adjacent faces), and the points. Each face has associated with it its point matrix, the matrix inverse, and its determinant. The initial d-simplex (in our implementation d = 3) is constructed using only basic algorithms, i.e., Gaussian Elimination (d^3 complexity, though since it's just in the beginning, the effect is infinitesimally small). However, thereafter, we use the expressions derived via the Sherman-Morrison Formula to calculate later determinants and inverse matrices. These functions have been called dyn_det and dyn_inv in our implementation. These functions, being of complexity d and d^2, reduce the runtime of our implemented code.
